    <h3><li>musical chair</h3>
        <p>A set of chairs is arranged with one fewer chair than the number of players (for example, nine players would use eight chairs). While music plays, the contestants walk around the set of chairs.<b></b>When the music stops abruptly, all players must find their own individual chair to sit on. The player who fails to sit on a chair is eliminated.<b></b> One chair is then removed for the next round, and the process repeats until only one player remains and is declared the winner.
